  "title": "investigate Toml big string tests ",
  "description_text": "* tests added in #383\r\n* testBiggerString indicates that only the TextBuffer.contentAsString() check is catching the issue with the string being too big\r\n  * no matter how big the len is set to\r\n  * this is far from ideal - we should be catching exceptions when the buffer is extended but the toml code has its own logic and somehow bypasses the checks in TextBuffer until the contentAsString() call."
